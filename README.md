# Business Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive financial and operational dashboard designed to analyze business performance using retail sales data. The objective of the dashboard is to transform raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights that support decision-making for non-technical stakeholders.

The dashboard focuses on evaluating revenue performance, profitability trends, and operational drivers across product categories and geographic regions. By combining key performance indicators with interactive visualizations, the solution enables users to quickly understand business health, identify performance patterns, and explore areas of opportunity or risk.

The project was developed as part of a practical assessment for the Data Analyst position, demonstrating analytical thinking, data visualization skills, and the ability to communicate insights effectively.

## Data Source

The analysis uses the **Sample Superstore dataset**, a widely adopted public dataset commonly used for business intelligence and analytics training. The dataset simulates retail transactional data and includes information on orders, sales, profit, product categories, customer segments, and regional performance.

The dataset contains:

- Order dates and transaction records  
- Sales revenue and profit values  
- Product categories and sub-categories  
- Regional market performance  
- Customer and order-level information  

This structure allows realistic business performance analysis and KPI development.

## Steps & Methodology

The project followed a structured analytical workflow:

First, the dataset was connected to Google Looker Studio and reviewed to ensure appropriate data types and aggregation logic. Key business metrics were defined to reflect organizational performance, including total sales, total profit, profit margin, total orders, and average order value.

Next, the dashboard layout was designed using a clear visual hierarchy to guide stakeholder interpretation. A large performance trend visualization was placed at the center of the dashboard to highlight time-based patterns, supported by category and regional analyses to explain performance drivers.

Interactive filters were implemented to allow users to dynamically explore results by region, category, and time period. Visualization choices prioritized clarity, consistency, and executive readability rather than visual complexity.

The design approach emphasized minimalism, consistent color usage, and structured sections to ensure the dashboard remains intuitive for decision-makers.
